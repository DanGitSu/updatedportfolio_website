				<h1>My History</h1>
			  </header>
		  
			  <p>I went to <span class ="school">Penrith Selective High School</span> and graduated Year 12 in 2019.</p>
		  
		  <p>During school I had an interest in computer asissted designing, architecture and engineering. Pursuing this interest I created a fully animated and working model of a radial engine.</p>
		  
		  <p>I was very involved in the schools chess club and with my team won the Interstate Chess Tournament Multiple Times and had a few personal victories. Here is my score card throughout the years.</p>

		  <p>I got really into computers after I attended the Questacon Invention Convention when I was in Year 10 and then in Year 11 attended the UNSW HS1511 Computer Science Course. My interest in computers has yet to cease and grows the more I study and learn about computing.</p>
